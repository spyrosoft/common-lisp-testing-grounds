;; Chapter 3 Exercises - Lists
;; 2. Write a version of union that preserves the order of the elements in the original lists:

(defmacro while (condition &rest body)
  `(do ()
       ((not ,condition))
     ,@body))

;; Intentionally horribly inefficient
(defun new-union (list1 list2 &key (test #'eql))
  (let ((used-items '())
        (list1-iterator list1)
        (list2-iterator list2)
        (new-list '()))
    (while (or list1-iterator list2-iterator)
      (when list1-iterator
        (if (not (member (first list1-iterator) used-items :test test))
            (progn
              (push (first list1-iterator) new-list)
              (push (first list1-iterator) used-items)))
        (setf list1-iterator (rest list1-iterator)))
      (when list2-iterator
        (if (not (member (first list2-iterator) used-items :test test))
            (progn
              (push (first list2-iterator) new-list)
              (push (first list2-iterator) used-items)))
        (setf list2-iterator (rest list2-iterator))))
    (reverse new-list)))

(new-union '(a b c) '(b a d))
;; (A B C D)

;; Note: it turns out that what he meant is that each of the lists from left to right need to preserve their original order. Not to parse both lists at the same time. Which makes this problem WAY easier:

(defun new-union (list1 list2)
  (let ((list1-reversed (reverse list1)))
    (dolist (list2-item list2)
      (if (not (member list2-item list1-reversed))
          (push list2-item list1-reversed)))
    (reverse list1-reversed)))



;; 3. Define a function that takes a list and returns a list indicating the number of times each (eql) element appears, sorted from most common element to least common:

(defun occurrences (list)
  (let ((occurrences '()))
    (dolist (item list)
      (if (getf occurrences item)
          (setf (getf occurrences item) (1+ (getf occurrences item)))
          (setf (getf occurrences item) 1)))
    occurrences))

(occurrences '(a b a d a c d e a))
;; (A 4 C 2 D 2 B 1)



;; 5. Suppose the function pos+ takes a list and returns a list of each element plus its position
;; Define this function using (a) recursion, (b) iteration, (c) mapcar.
;; (a)

(defun pos+ (list)
  "Not tail optimized"
  (labels ((recursive-pos+ (list current-position)
             (if (null list)
                 list
                 (cons (+ current-position (first list))
                       (recursive-pos+ (rest list) (1+ current-position))))))
    (recursive-pos+ list 0)))

                   (push (+ current-position (first unprocessed-list)) processed-list)
                   (recursive-pos+ (rest unprocessed-list) processed-list (1+ current-position))))))
    (reverse (recursive-pos+ list '() 0))))

;; (b)

(defun pos+ (list)
  (let ((new-list '()))
    (do ((position 0 (1+ position))
         (list-iterator list (rest list-iterator)))
        ((null list-iterator))
      (push (+ (first list-iterator) position) new-list))
    (reverse new-list)))

;; (c)

(defun pos+ (list)

    (mapcar #'(lambda (item)
                (incf current-position)

;; 9. Write a program to find the longest finite path through a network represented as in Section 3.15. The network may contain cycles.
(defun longest-path (start goal network)
  (depth-first-search goal (list (list start)) network))

(defun depth-first-search (goal stack network)
  (if (null stack)
      nil

;; Chapter 4 - Specialized Data Structures
;; 1. Define a function to take a square array (an array whose dimensions are (n n)) and rotate it 90Â° clockwise:

(defun quarter-turn (array-to-turn)
  (let* ((square-dimensions (first (array-dimensions array-to-turn)))
         (turned-array (make-array (list square-dimensions square-dimensions))))
